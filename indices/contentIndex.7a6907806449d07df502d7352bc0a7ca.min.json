Ephemeral ones should be avoided all together in the first place\n- if you have enough extra money to spend (disposable income), the price paid shouldn't factor into if a purchase is justified.  All acquired items should be treated the same wether they are paid for or free (? back this up or refute it). \n    - what about dumster diving?\n    - how do we treat gifts then? Acquired possessions that we do not choose to let into our life?\n- on a personal note, I like 'window shopping' and seeing what retailers have to sell. I don't frequently impulse purchase\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-21T04:20:31.905140074Z","tags":null}}
