# establish a highline
> find a new area or line that other will safely and easily be able to rig
- must have bombproof anchors
- in an area that allows slackline use
- within day trip range of NYC metro area
- hopefully accessible to beginners (possibly a shorter line w/ a riggable overhead handline)

# send a 70m line
- 60m feels good, lets stretch the distance out

# ~~exposure on a highline~~
- ~~motivation: in order to turn easily~~
- ~~leave your comfort zone~~
- I tried it and felt pretty good, now time to work on it more

# Solo Rig a highline
- already tagged solo
- almost rigged a line solo but had some help pulling the rig across (and tensioning)
- practice more methods to accomplish this (z drag, etc)
- fix twisted tapes on line
- buy double pulleys for ease of tensioning
