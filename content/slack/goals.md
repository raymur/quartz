# establish a highline
> find a new area or line that other will safely and easily be able to rig
- must have bombproof anchors
- in an area that allows slackline use
- within day trip range of NYC metro area
- hopefully accessible to beginners (possibly a shorter line w/ a riggable overhead handline)

# send a 70m line
- 60m feels good, lets stretch the distance out

# exposure on a highline
- motivation: in order to turn easily
- leave your comfort zone
