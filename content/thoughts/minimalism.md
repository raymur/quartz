title: "minimalism"

This might relate to many aspects of my life.  I'm far from a minimalist but am intrigued by their values.  

Two examples:
- with [climbing](climb/climbing.md), what is the minimal amount of gear that I need in order to safely ascend this wall.  Can I leave my chalk bag at the base? belay device? cord? extra alpine draw biners? active pro? harness (and just use a swami)?

- programming minimal setup, minimal lines of code
