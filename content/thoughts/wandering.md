* The following is a digital public scrap piece of paper

hi. thats it for now
finally got it up and running. now to record my [thoughts](thoughts)

Is this going to be a public journal or will it be a notebook to document the world? It could be both, by using different sections.

Technology overuse
------------------

Consumerism
-----------
- consumerism vs materialism
- buying 'to scratch the itch' vs buying for the long haul
- evil vs good
- certain possessions that we'll use should be cherished and taken care of.  Ephemeral ones should be avoided all together in the first place
- if you have enough extra money to spend (disposable income), the price paid shouldn't factor into if a purchase is justified.  All acquired items should be treated the same wether they are paid for or free (? back this up or refute it). 
    - what about dumster diving?
    - how do we treat gifts then? Acquired possessions that we do not choose to let into our life?
- on a personal note, I like 'window shopping' and seeing what retailers have to sell. I don't frequently impulse purchase
