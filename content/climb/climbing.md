## racking systems

for single pitch trad climbing
- **left front: ** rack or totems + small cams + nuts
- **right front: ** rack of friends
- **left rear: ** 5 x single length alpine draws, 2 x quickdraw
- **right rear: ** 4 x double length rounnder, 2 x alpine, 2 x qd
- **rear: ** locking carabiner (more gear if anchor building is required)

for multipitch trad climbing add to rear gear loop: 
- atc guide + 2 x locking biners
- walkie talkie + knife + biner
- prussik + locker
- cordalette + biner
_*possibly more gear can be added for rescue, building belays, etc_
_*the left and right gear loops feel a little crowded with more than 8 biners_
