# birthday challenge
> 28 pitches at the [gunks](climb/gunks) in a weekend
motivation: excuse to climb a lot and spend time with my friends who also share the same passion

# gym climbing
> send all of the hardest, most sandbagged routes at your current grade
motivation: you want to work on weaknesses and put yourself on stuff that scares you a bit.  Pretty much everything is (relatively) safe in a gym, so work on getting rid of that fear/mental laziness.
