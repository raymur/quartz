# Mission/Values
> To journey the world enjoying the variety of movements and adventures that rock has to offer.
> To value safety over sending.
> To cherish the connections with other climbers I meet along the way.
I'd like to put this into more digestable, actionale terms: stive to be a generalist by always focusing on your weaknesses.
1. work on your weaknesses (Tricky sequences, both powerful and techy crimpy moves, body position dependant negative holds, OW, finger cracks)
2. Prevent injury (both minor and catostrophic)
3. Push yourself.  I've sent 20 5.10b's but only 5 5.10c's.  Throw yourself at slightly more difficult routes.


# birthday challenge
> 28 pitches at the [gunks](climb/gunks) in a weekend
motivation: excuse to climb a lot and spend time with my friends who also share the same passion
[Example](https://www.mountainproject.com/forum/topic/111868034/gunks-birthday-challenge)
- 2 partners that swap following: 1 to follow, one to scope out next route
- fixed rap lines

# ~~gym climbing~~
> send all of the hardest, most sandbagged routes at your current grade
motivation: you want to work on weaknesses and put yourself on stuff that scares you a bit.  Pretty much everything is (relatively) safe in a gym, so work on getting rid of that fear/mental laziness.
(Pretty happy to try hard moves on lead)

# ~~pushing grades~~
> climb >= 5.11a this year
grades are somewhat arbitrary.  It's importatnt not to tie your self-worth to a number.  This goal is mostly here to remind me to leave my comfort zone and attempt climbs I wont necissarily send.
(sent Amarillo Sunset 5.11b)

# ~~powerlinez sport climbs~~
> send all 5 routes at that crag
currently I have just 1 route left.  Hopefully I can close out this mini chapter soon.
(Redpointed all 5)

# ~~gunks 5.9~~
> push it
send a classic 5.9
- headpoint it if you need
- golden dream, PK
(4 sends so far:  commando rave, sente, higher stannard, ants line)
